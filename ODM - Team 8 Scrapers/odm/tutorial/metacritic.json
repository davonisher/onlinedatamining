However, none of that really matters, a month later? Who fricking cares, yes I had some of it spoiled, but I should have kept away from the batman forums to be sure. Still the story keeps me intrigued, the combat is insanely good, and the atmosphere is amazing. Can't do much about GFWL and SecuRom, they don't make the game worse, they are just bad choiced to safeguard against people playing without paying. The DX11 thing is something that they already are aware of, and they will fix it.

Players experience beach assaults, jungle fighting, close quarters night fighting and more across Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima and Saipan, among other iconic battles. The player is able to take the part of either side – American or Japanese – battling it out online in multiplayer on up to 64-player servers. Rising Storm also introduces an entirely new type of gameplay to the franchise - asymmetrical warfare. The American’s have the apparent advantage in firepower with their fast firing semi-automatic rifles, fully automatic weapons, and devastating flamethrower. The Japanese balance this out with gameplay elements that model their raw courage, ferocity, and cunning use of equipment. Their knee mortars allow them to rain indirect fire down on their enemies from anywhere in the map. Grenades can be planted and turned into booby-traps for unwary GIs. The Japanese put very high store on close-quarter combat, with a bayonet on almost every weapon – even machine guns and SMGs.

My main issue with the game were it’s rating system of your interrogations. I didn’t feel they were very fair. It seemed that pretty much every interrogation I did was not handled to their satisfaction. The thing is I was actually trying to do what they wanted, I wasn’t trying to be some rebel and free all of the androids. I ended up being decommissioned as a deviant and many of the dialogue responses I got to use at that point acted as if I was part of some underground movement trying to overthrow the company. I guess I just sucked at the job but there was no option for that story arc. Putting this aside I did enjoy the game. There is a lot of different questions you can ask and the game does a good job of letting you know what kind of response you are getting as well as things you can try to get the responses you need. The graphics are decent all around. I didn’t feel that there were any parts of them that either wowed me or made me cringe in horror. The music was well done. The script was very good and being that there was no voice acting this was important.\r", "Userscore": null, "Release_date": "Apr 20, 2021", "Genre": "Action", "Developer": "Clockwork Bird", "Publisher": "Clockwork Bird", "Image": "https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/d82f68fe4d30eb509d2fb02da2286023-98.jpg", "Awards": ["#71 Best PC Game of 2021"]},

You play a General hidden deep within an underground bunker. Your mission is to successfully exterminate your enemy's civilian population whilst saving your own. Points are awarded or lost depending on both the efficacy and thoroughness of your nuclear vendetta and the number of your own civilian deaths. In order to win you must wipe out the enemy population and simultaneously disable the enemy's ability to retaliate against you. This is an extremely difficult task since launching an attack on the enemy exposes the positions of your own Ground Silos, Subs and Bombers the moment they launch nuclear weapons, making you extremely vulnerable and exposed to a crushing counter-attack. Desperate attempts must be made to form fast, tactical alliances, alliances that may at any moment break-down to become the treacherous and most deadly of betrayals. Everyone looks to each other in a state of nervous suspense and paranoid accusation. In all-out nuclear Armageddon, everybody dies, everybody loses, you just have to make sure you lose the least!

Begin your odyssey at the dawn of life as a simple microbe just trying to survive, then use the fun, intuitive Editors to evolve the creature from its microscopic origins into an intelligent, tool-using race. Guide your species as it builds (and the player designs) villages, buildings, cities, and vehicles. Along the way to becoming a global civilization you can choose whether to hunt or forage, attack or trade, be nice or play rough. All the action takes place in a huge, lush world populated with creatures evolved by other players and shared over SPORE's central servers. When it's ready, your one-time pond scum launches into space in its UFO on a grand voyage of discovery, planet forming, or destruct-ion. As you explore and play in this limitless universe of unique worlds, your personal Sporepedia tracks all the creatures you've met and places you've visited. Take complete control of your creature's fate as you guide it through the following six evolutionary phases: Tidepool phase: Fight with other creatures and consume them to adjust the form and abilities of your creature. It's survival of the fittest at the most microscopic level. Creature phase: Venture onto dry land and help your creature learn and evolve with forays away from your safe haven. Carnivore or Herbivore? Social or Independent? The choice is yours. Tribal phase: Instead of controlling an individual creature, you are now caring for an entire tribe of your genetic craftwork. Give them tools and guide their interactions as you slowly upgrade their state of existence. City phase: Bring your creatures' race into a new golden era by building up the technology, architecture, and infrastructure of their city. Civilization phase: Once your city is established, your creatures begin seeking out and interacting with other cultures. You can have them do so with an olive branch or a war cry—either way, the goal for your creatures is to unify the planet. Space phase: The time has come to move on to other worlds in your solar system. Make first-contact, colonize, or terraform, then venture further to find other solar systems scattered throughout a magnificently rendered galaxy. A 'mission' structure provides new goals and paths to follow as you begin to spread through the universe.

A thousand years ago, the crusaders of Azunai crossed swords with the legions of Zaramoth in the final battle of a century-long rebellion. As the tyrannical god Zaramoth struck the final blow through Azunai's trembling shield, the earth shook. In that moment, the forces of magic were unchained, and both armies were consumed in a brilliant cataclysm that stretched for leagues across the Plain of Tears. Only a scarred wasteland remained as final testament to the First Age of Man. And for a millennium, magic has continued to spread to the farthest corners of the world, freely flowing to any who would command it. But the tide of magic has begun to wane, heeding instead the call of an ancient legacy. From the Plain of Tears a new heir beckons, and with each day his strength grows. Consuming those who submit, eradicating those who resist. With none to oppose his ascendance, the circle will be complete, and an ancient age will begin anew. What fate will befall the Second Age of Man? The time for judgment is nigh.

I have returned from my slumber and the first thing I played through was Trine 4. What an amazing game this is. Let's start at the beginning. Trine 4 returns to the 2d style of Trine 1 & 2. It's not in 3d like Trine 3. Storywise, Trine 4 takes place some years/months after Trine 3... that is a fact  proven by something in Trine 4, but I won't reveal where. That's for you to find out. We have a new story involving a prince whose nightmares are overtaking every place he visits. This time our heroes are summoned by the astral academy headmaster to take care of the problem. That's the story. I loved all the references to the previous adventures of our heroes. If you remember previous games, you'll have a smile on your face many times. When it comes to the gameplay, it's basically Trine 2 but with some new mechanics, I love the fairy rope and dream shield the most. With all of our abilities we can now solve most of the puzzles in many ways, not just one. You can also upgrade your heroes, but I've finished the game 100% without spending even a point. That means you can finish the entire game without upgrading anything... it will certainly make the game harder, but if you enjoy the challenge like me then go for it. I don't need to tell you about the graphics, because they're gorgeous as usual. Sounds are nice too. Overall, this game is a must for anyone who liked the previous games. It's my fav part of Trine right after Trine: Enchanted Edition for which I will always have a soft spot. If you have never played Trine before, that's not a deal breaker. You won't understand some references, but you won't be lost either. Go buy this stuff on gog, steam or whatever (but, I'd recommend gog, because you actually get to keep your game, not rent it).
