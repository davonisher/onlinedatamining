The callbacks and relationships from the previous games grow and evolve, and it’s exciting to see these beloved characters find their place in the ever-expanding world. While I often say the latest Atelier game is the best Atelier game, it’s always true. This time, Gust have outdone themselves, and I simply cannot wait to see how they top this highly polished gem of a game."},

The most disappointing aspect is how bogged down it is with technical issues that prevent a seamless online co-op experience. A lot of the joy in hunting monsters is being able to do it with friends. Despite featuring cross-platform play, I preferred to play WILD HEARTS alone rather than be bothered with the slow-downs that I encountered. It shows great promise with their weapon types and the upgrading mechanics, but ultimately WILD HEARTS feels like an unfinished product. I hope that the upcoming content updates can turn that around. In the meantime, I’d look elsewhere for getting that next hunt in."},

But the overall lack of polish and questionable balancing nevertheless proves to be unfortunate, and it still never manages to be as satisfying as its model.

{"game_title": "Wild Hearts", "critic_name": "Worth Playing", "meta_score": "65", "review_date": "Mar 7, 2023", "review_text": "There's potential in Wild Hearts. The building aspects alone add some depth to the exploration and combat aspects of the hunt, while the weapons feel right in a fight. There are many compelling reasons to give this a go: a drip feed of abilities, near-instant multiplayer with cross-play, and permanently affecting a player's instance. The sometimes-finicky building system can be an annoyance, while the lack of kemono variety is a knock, even if more beasts are promised later as free updates. The PC performance is what really drags down the game, and the lack of fixes combined with the game's high price tag are enough to hold off for now. On consoles, Wild Hearts is a fine counterpart to Capcom's offering, and it's worth checking out. PC players will want to wait and see if the game can make efficient use of the platform and hardware variety before jumping in."},

The most disappointing aspect is how bogged down it is with technical issues that prevent a seamless online co-op experience. A lot of the joy in hunting monsters is being able to do it with friends. Despite featuring cross-platform play, I preferred to play WILD HEARTS alone rather than be bothered with the slow-downs that I encountered. It shows great promise with their weapon types and the upgrading mechanics, but ultimately WILD HEARTS feels like an unfinished product. I hope that the upcoming content updates can turn that around. In the meantime, I’d look elsewhere for getting that next hunt in."},

Playing solo isn’t beginner friendly, and is relatively time-consuming. While the gameplay and battles are enjoyable as a whole, combining building with tactical fighting, we couldn’t help but feel like the stutters and slow pace held us back from the fast-paced experience we looked for.

With the ability to create traps and other constructs on the field of battle, Wild Hearts has created a new hunting experience that could certainly stand toe to toe with a more well-established series. Future patches and DLC could certainly iron some of these problems out, but as it stands upon release, Wild Hearts is difficult to recommend in its launch state to all but the most hard-core of hunters. With that said, the foundation laid out by this title is quite solid, and could certainly lead to greater things in the future."},

Wild Hearts is set in Minato, a small, forgotten corner of an otherwise war-torn world. Rival clans battle over territory and succession rights, brutalizing both each other and the very ground upon which they walk. This has, in time, led to an abundance of refugees and those who refuse to participate in the war machine. Your hunter is one of those people. In a brief conversation with another character, they ask why you left your home to hunt kemono, and you are offered two options: “I don’t want to talk about it,” or “Because they asked me to hunt people instead.”"},

Titans that I think the Crossbell games surpass even. I adore the Trails games and Azure has further cemented this series as one of my favorite RPG franchises of all time. I can’t wait to join back up with the Special Support Section later this year with Trails Into Reverie. Trails fans, we’re eating good this year, and Trails to Azure is one hell of a starting course."},

I honestly wish that more games would let me just turn them into a Castlevania spin-off. What’s the matter, Mario? Think you’re better than Castlevania? Well, you’re not, so put on this leather cuirass and carry this whip. Wait, that sounded weird."},

For every work of artistry in the sound design and environments, there’s a scene of utterly sub-par scripting. It’s glorious and tedious, polished and patchwork all the same time, and while there’s an anarchic part of my brain that wants more ambitious-yet-wonky games like it, stronger is my hope that Mundfish’s second game has a tighter grasp on its own strengths and weaknesses."},

It’s the closest thing to a killer app that VR is going to get any time soon. The format still has its shortcomings and likely always will, but with Half-Life: Alyx, it’s very close to realizing its full potential. If you think back to the first time that you visualized what VR would look like and feel like, then you probably envisioned something very similar to what Half-Life: Alyx has to offer.

Instead, the masterful combination of all these great qualities is what really makes Elden Ring special. Yes, the game has stopped me in my tracks multiple times, forcing me to leave bosses and places for later due to the somewhat slower progression system.

This is the result of a clear, determined vision, its separate elements harmonizing almost perfectly to deliver an experience that understands the series’ blood-soaked origins but is also not afraid to push it into a more mature and nuanced direction. Kratos and Atreus’ relationship develops naturally as does their understanding of the foreign land they’re journeying through. The story takes its time, never rushing its satisfying reveals, and making way for a set of surprisingly personal boss fights, while the continuous camera shot used throughout the game is a masterstroke in terms of presentation. All this is built around a snappy and responsive combat system that has more depth than you’re initially led to believe. There are more jaw-dropping surprises I didn’t touch upon simply because it’s best that you experience them for yourself. Looking back, aside from the port’s few performance flaws, my only real complaint has to do with Sony taking this long to bring the game to PC."},

Much like any FromSoftware title, it's not going to be for everybody, but paradoxically it is one of their hardest and one of their most accessible to date. It offers huge value in one package, and perhaps is a little too much value, only becoming clearer when nearing the endgame. Don't be mistaken by the criticism, though.

But the lack of any numerical identifier might also be read as a statement of ambition, or even permanence: what’s on offer, here, isn’t the final flight simulator so much as it is the forever one.

But the lack of any numerical identifier might also be read as a statement of ambition, or even permanence: what’s on offer, here, isn’t the final flight simulator so much as it is the forever one.

Adventures in past Souls games tend to line up, as you're all wandering down the same pathways. But that's not the case with Elden Ring. You might show your bruise to Barry and he'll peel his hair back to reveal a scar or a massive indent or a tattoo of a mouse tustling with a skeleton. Both of may be five hours in but you'll be on totally different trajectories. No matter how hostile the game's world may be, it pushes you to succeed and carve out your own adventures.

This is yet another win for both PC players and Uncharted fans, as the enhancements seen here allow for an even greater depth of immersion, with the potential to push visuals and performance to a whole other level. This is the smoothest PlayStation-on-PC game I’ve played so far, and it’s clear that the quality of ports is continuing to improve and close in on perfection."},

Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End may seem like a strange place to jump into the series but it works, while Uncharted: The Lost Legacy is pretty much worth the asking price alone as it’s such a well-rounded adventure.

This new version allows you to experience all of that officially, and in a modernized form, somewhere other than a Sony console for the first time."},

However, the development of Iron Galaxy was outstanding, and the gaming experience is enjoyable as long as you have an up-to-date mid-range or high-end rig. There is no doubt that the titles in this collection are of very high quality and are worth enjoying on PC. Perhaps in this way, PlayStation will be encouraged to bring its franchises to this platform faster."},

The new PC release pulls them from the past into something very close to present day standards, not that they ever looked bad. In terms of fun factor, writing and action, Uncharted 4 remains compelling. PC players, your long wait is over. The Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves collection is definitely worth your time and money. If you’ve already played it on PS5, the port isn’t going to be a revelation or substantially different."},

Both included games remain fantastic entries in the series, and that's saying something, considering how almost every title in the franchise is held in high regard.

PC players will appreciate the unlocked nature of the graphics, and even if you don't have the best hardware, you'll still be able to enjoy something that's on par with what PS4 players have already seen and heard.

We note here some improvements in terms of aliasing and lighting effects compared to the PS5 version. It's very simple, the Naughty Dog blockbuster has never been so sumptuous."},

It is unfortunate that Sony didn’t release the first three games before this though, but you can play these directly. If you already played them on PS4 or PS5 and are wondering how they are on Steam Deck, I’d wait for a discount before buying them to play on the go. While they hold up well, there are too many caveats to this recommendation at full price if you already played these games before. If you haven’t the price is worth it assuming you’re ok with the storage requirements."},

There's support for both FSR (handy for Intel and AMD GPUs) as well as Nvidia's proprietary DLSS, which improved performance as expected when active. Each of the game's lush environments was packed with details, although that shouldn't be surprising given how handsome it already is on PS5. There aren't any PC-exclusive visual features, such as ray tracing, so don't expect a drastic improvement such as the one Spider-Man Remastered received on that front."},

Granted, most of these scenarios aren’t particularly realistic, but that’s the whole point: you’re in it for the absolute absurdity of the events. Whether it’s escaping a crumbling structure while dodging fists and a hail of gunfire, or falling from a clock tower only with a couple of scuffs, it’s an overly-entertaining experience. The best part is now you’re able to experience all of this on PC where you’re able to control the level of detail, resolution and framerate. Iron Galaxy has done a magnificent job porting over two of Naughty Dog’s fantastic pieces of work, creating an even greater spectacle that fans can enjoy. Whether you’re new to the franchise or a long-time fan, the PC version of Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection only helps excel the franchise in a greater direction."},

It’s another solid Sony first-party port, even if Uncharted 4's writing isn't aging particularly well. We can only recommend the collection with some caveats.
